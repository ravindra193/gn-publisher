GN Publisher makes RSS feeds that comply with the [Google News RSS Feed Technical Requirements](https://support.google.com/news/publisher-center/answer/9545420) for including your site in the [Google News Publisher Center](https://publishercenter.google.com/).

The plugin addresses common RSS compatiblity issues publishers experience when using the Google News Publisher Center, including:

-  Delayed crawling by Google

After installing, click on the *'Dashboard'* under GN Publisher on your plugins page for additional information about applying and troubleshooting issues related to the Google News Publisher Center.
